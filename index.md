## Hi! I'm Isaac!

### About me:

I'm a data scientist in the making who enjoys extracting the signal from noise. I am a master's student at the Goegen Institute for Data Science in Rochester, NY. I believe the best way to understand the world is through data! In my free time, I like reading, fencing, gaming with friends, or falling off of rocks. 

### Proof I can code:
```
def complicated_data_mining(x):
    
    for i in range(len(x)):
      import pandas
      import numpy
      print('Hello World!')
      pandas.DataFrame(x)
    
    return x.describe()
      
```
