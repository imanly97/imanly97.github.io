## Hi! I'm Isaac!

### About me:

I'm a data scientist in the making who enjoys extracting the signal from noise. I am a master's student at the Goegen Institute for Data Science in Rochester, NY. I believe the best way to understand the world is through data! Most recently my professional work has been on an asset management team at a start up and modeling client behavior for a fortune 700 HR company. On the life side of the ol' work-life balance, I like to spend my free time reading, fencing, gaming with friends, or falling off of rocks.

### Projects I've done:

Here's [my Github repo](https://github.com/imanly97) where you can find non-professional projects!

•	FLX AI: Command line tool for automated strategy evaluation in python. The tool would read in trades, format them, and output extensive evaluation including visualizations and statistics on time, stability, risk, etc.
•	Paychex: Used classification models to predict which Paychex clients would agree to upgrade their Professional Employer Organization services if approached by Paychex for Master’s exit exam. Implemented methods like SVM and Logistic Regression
•	Machine Vision: Implemented a CNN to predict the rating of a book given its poster in python. An accuracy of 81% was achieved over 5 classes. 
•	Data Mining 1: Citi Bike predictive modeling. Used a few supervised methods like Naïve Bayes and NN’s to predict the end location of a NYC user’s trip. The best average error achieved was 1.8 miles.
•	Data Mining 2: Unsupervised fake news detection. Used several unsupervised methods to separate a dataset into real and fake news. The best accuracy achieved was 78% via KMeans. Much of this paper was focused on feature engineering such as sentiment analysis
•	Economics Thesis: Investigated the relationship between the West Africa Ebola Epidemic and West African Inequality. This study used multiple regression with causal mechanisms being unemployment and foreign investment.

### Proof I can code:
```
def complicated_data_mining(x):
    
    for i in range(len(x)):
      import pandas
      import numpy
      print('Hello World!')
      pandas.DataFrame(x)
    
    return x.describe()
      
```
